# Nabin Ranabhat's Portfolio

A modern portfolio website for Nabin Ranabhat, a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at Pulchowk Campus with expertise in Web Development and a growing focus on AI/ML.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems. While my background is in web development and backend systems, I've recently shifted my focus to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to expand my skills and knowledge in these cutting-edge fields.

## Projects

### AI/ML Projects

- **BERT-NER Document Extraction System**: Developed a system using BERT for Named Entity Recognition to automatically extract information from citizenship documents and auto-fill forms, streamlining document processing workflows.

- **Machine Learning Implementations**: Implemented various machine learning algorithms from the "Hands-On Machine Learning" book using Jupyter Notebooks, covering regression, classification, clustering, and more.

### Web Development Projects

- **[Project Name]**: Brief description of a significant web development project.

- **[Project Name]**: Brief description of another web development project.

## Skills

### AI/ML

- Machine Learning algorithms
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- BERT and transformer models
- Python for Data Science
- Jupyter Notebooks
- TensorFlow/PyTorch

### Web Development

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
- Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- RESTful API design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd c:\Users\acer\Desktop\Portfolio_new
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Then start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

## Project Structure

- `/app`: Contains the main application pages and layout
- `/components`: Reusable React components
- `/public`: Static assets like images and fonts
- `/app/globals.css`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration
